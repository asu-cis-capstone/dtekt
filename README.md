The Goal:

Sun Devil Igniter Challenge

Win $50,000 to bring your entrepreneurial idea to life!

The Sun Devil Igniter Challenge is open to all ASU students who see the reward in risk and possess the drive to create change through a disruptive, innovative idea. Hosted by the W. P. Carey School of Business, this annual event is unlike any other university entrepreneurship competition.

The Igniter Challenge features two highly competitive phases. In Phase One, up to five finalists are selected from entries across ASU and given $5,000 to enhance and improve their idea. In Phase Two, the finalists present their finished concept, with one winner awarded $50,000 to transform their idea into reality.

The Igniter Challenge Board of Directors — a highly-sought after, prestigious, experienced group of serial entrepreneurs and active investors — will be involved every step of the way. An unprecedented advisory experience, the Board will not only judge the competition, but also act as a “Board of Directors” for the winning entrepreneurial team in the first year following the competition — the “Igniter Year”.
